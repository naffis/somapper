somapper
========

SOMapper was a Google Maps hack that mapps the location of sex offenders in DC and Maryland. It was created around May 2005. 

It was slashdotted (http://science.slashdot.org/story/05/06/23/220229/slashback-summer-sail-sex-offenders) and then subsequently taken down after numerous death threats :)
